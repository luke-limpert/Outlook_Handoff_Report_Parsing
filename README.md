# Outlook_Handoff_Report_Parsing
 Comb through outlook and aggregate handoff reports
 
 This program seeks to take reports from outlook emails
 and compile all of the data into one larger data set.
 Due to the reporting systems in the organization these reports 
 are the only accurate representation of completed components 
 sent out by production.
 
 Many of the problems I have had in this project so far come 
 from the way they choose to place the report into the email.
 
Some copy and paste from their excel spreadsheets and the 
testfile.txt shows an example of that output when it is saved
as a text file. One way of dealing with these emails is by 
substitution of the new line with "". This produces the 
"substituted.txt". It looks something like the example below.

From there i can use regex to get the information out of it 
pertaining to the production target vs actual. 

(?P<Line>[A-Za-z0-9]*)  
(?:\s)  
(?P<Stage>[A-Za-z]*)  
(?P<Target>\d{3})  
(?P<Actual>\d{1,3})  

Tried to make it a bit VERBOSE for readability. 

The other challenge is when there is no copy pasted report in the 
email and instead they choose to include it as an excel spreadsheet.

This is the part i am currently working on, but i think i should just
be able to resave those documents as .csv files.
